# NeoBank

## Overview
NeoBank is a small project that simulates a basic banking system. It allows an admin to create, manage, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user accounts. This project is designed to practice and demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in PHP.

## Features
- Admin can create new accounts.
- Perform full CRUD operations on accounts.
- Simple, clean user interface for management.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, TailwindCSS
- **Database**: SQL

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
- **Inheritance**: Allowing a class to inherit properties and methods from another class to promote code reuse.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability to define methods in different ways, enabling a single interface to represent different underlying forms (e.g., method overriding).
- **Abstraction**: Hiding the complex implementation details of a class and exposing only the essential features.
